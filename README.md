# Sapphire_G4CMP
Program to Create Caustic Phonon Plots.
Description of the program 
What was your motivation? In order to utilize qubits as particle detectors, understanding energy dissipation in qubit substrate ( Sapphire) phonon kinematics is essential. These mechanisms are strongly associated with correlated errors in qubit chips, as observed in cosmic muon and gamma ray absorption events reported recently. We are motivated to undertand  the scattering of sub-Mev Dark Matter (for scalar and vector mediators) and the phonon excitations with sub-eV energy in Sapphire.  attempt to better understand energy dissipation in Sapphire with phonon caustics and kinematics simulation
The phonon simulations on Si and Ge have been proved on G4CMP. 
Why did you build this project?
attempt to better understand energy dissipation in Sapphire with phonon caustics and kinematics simulation.
What problem does it solve?
The project show how to obtain phonon caustics for differents material 
What did you learn?

What makes your project stand out?
This is the firts simulation for a new material implementing on G4CMP after 10 year.
How to execute the program?
The phonon simualtions includes 
A Sapphire subtrate of 2mm x 2mm x 2mm.
A big bolometer sensor of 2mm x 2mm x 0.0001 mm.
the new config.txt file with all the parameters for Sapphire subtrate.
The Causitic.mac file to generate 40e+6 phonos with isotropic intial random momentum .
The Caustic_plot.root to plor the caustic pattern for Transverse Slow Phononos, Transvers Fast Phonons or both togheter.
